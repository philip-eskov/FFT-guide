# FFT-guide

## Description 
This repository is for organizing the development of a basic guide to the FFT and frequency domain analysis in Python using Scipy's FFT sub-package. It is developed by students at the University of Oslo under the Center for Computing in Science Education (CCSE). 

The structure and contents of the guide are outlined in plan.md. The plan so far is for each subsection to have its own Jupyter notebook.
